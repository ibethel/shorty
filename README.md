# About Shorty

Shorty is a quick and dirty, yet highly useful, URL shortener written for Bethel Church.  The basic premise is that it allows
any user with an "@ibethel.org" email address to quickly create shortened URLs to provide to the public.

These URLs are tracked by referrer and by visitor, allowing us to gain a better understanding of who is sending traffic our
direction and who those users are.

### Todo
1. Write tests
2. Capture more information about users
3. Better reporting output
